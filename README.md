# Autonomous-Rocket-Landing-and-AI <br>
Trained a rocket to land autonomously at a specific target location using the OpenAI lunar lander gym environment. Deep Q Learning played a pivotal role in this achievement, as it allowed the agent to learn optimal actions by estimating the quality of different states, while Reinforcement Learning allowed it to train through interactions with the environment to improve the agents decision. <br>
